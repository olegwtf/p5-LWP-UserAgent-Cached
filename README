LWP::UserAgent::Cached - LWP::UserAgent with simple caching mechanism
======================

When you process content from some website, you will get page one by one and extract
some data from this page with regexp, DOM parser or smth else. Sometimes we makes
errors in our data extractors and realize this only when all 1_000_000 pages were
processed. We should fix our extraction logic and start all process from the beginning.
Please STOP! How about cache? Yes, you can cache all responses and second, third and
other attempts will be very fast.
LWP::UserAgent::Cached is yet another LWP::UserAgent subclass with cache support. It
stores cache in the files on local filesystem and if response already available in the
cache returns it instead of making HTTP request.
