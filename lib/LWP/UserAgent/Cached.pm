=head1 NAME

LWP::UserAgent::Cached - LWP::UserAgent with simple caching mechanism

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use LWP::UserAgent::Cached;
    
    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Cached->new(cache_dir => '/tmp/lwp-cache');
    my $resp = $ua->get('http://google.com/'); # makes http request
    
    ...
    
    $resp = $ua->get('http://google.com/'); # no http request - will get it from the cache

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you process content from some website, you will get page one by one and extract some data from this
page with regexp, DOM parser or smth else. Sometimes we makes errors in our data extractors and realize this
only when all 1_000_000 pages were processed. We should fix our extraction logic and start all process from the
beginning. Please STOP! How about cache? Yes, you can cache all responses and second, third and other attempts will
be very fast.

LWP::UserAgent::Cached is yet another LWP::UserAgent subclass with cache support. It stores
cache in the files on local filesystem and if response already available in the cache returns it instead of making HTTP request.
This module was writed because other available alternatives didn't meet my needs:

=over

=item L<LWP::UserAgent::WithCache>

caches responses on local filesystem and gets it from the cache only if online document was not modified

=item L<LWP::UserAgent::Cache::Memcached>

same as above but stores cache in memory

=item L<LWP::UserAgent::Snapshot>

can record responses in the cache or get responses from the cache, but not both for one useragent

=item L<LWP::UserAgent::OfflineCache>

seems it may cache responses and get responses from the cache, but has too much dependencies and unclear
`delay' parameter

=back

=head1 METHODS

All LWP::UserAgent methods and several new.

=head2 new(...)

Creates new LWP::UserAgent::Cached object. Since LWP::UserAgent::Cached is LWP::UserAgent subclass it has all same
parameters, but in additional it has some new optional pararmeters:

L<cache_dir|/"cache_dir() or cache_dir($dir)">

L<nocache_if|/"nocache_if() or nocache_if($sub)">

L<recache_if|/"recache_if() or recache_if($sub)">

L<on_uncached|/"on_uncached() or on_uncached($sub)">

L<cachename_spec|/"cachename_spec() or cachename_spec($spec)">

LWP::UserAgent::Cached creation example:

    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Cached->new(cache_dir => 'cache/lwp', nocache_if => sub {
        my $response = shift;
        return $response->code >= 500; # do not cache any bad response
    }, recache_if => sub {
        my ($response, $path, $request) = @_;
        return $response->code == 404 && -M $path > 1; # recache any 404 response older than 1 day
    }, on_uncached => sub {
        my $request = shift;
        sleep 5 if $request->uri =~ '/category/\d+'; # delay before http requests inside "/category"
    }, cachename_spec => {
        'User-Agent' => undef, # omit agent while calculating cache name
    });

=head2 cache_dir() or cache_dir($dir)

Gets or sets path to the directory where cache will be stored.
If not set useragent will behaves as LWP::UserAgent without cache support.

=head2 nocache_if() or nocache_if($sub)

Gets or sets reference to subroutine which will be called after receiving each non-cached response. First parameter
of this subroutine will be HTTP::Response object. This subroutine should return true if this response should
not be cached and false otherwise. If not set all responses will be cached.

=head2 recache_if() or recache_if($sub)

Gets or sets reference to subroutine which will be called for each response available in the cache. First parameter
of this subroutine will be HTTP::Response object, second - path to file with cache, third - HTTP::Request object.
This subroutine should return true if response needs to be recached (new HTTP request will be made) and false otherwise.
This $sub will be called only if response already available in the cache. Here you can also modify request for your needs.
This will not change name of the file with cache.

=head2 on_uncached() or on_uncached($sub)

Gets or sets reference to subroutine which will be called for each non-cached http request, before actually request.
First parameter of this subroutine will be HTTP::Request object. Here you can also modify request for your needs.
This will not change name of the file with cache.

=head2 cachename_spec() or cachename_spec($spec)

Gets or sets hash reference to cache naming specification. In fact cache naming for each request based on request content.
Internally it is md5_hex($request->as_string). But what if some of request headers in your program changed dinamically, e.g.
User-Agent or Cookie? In such case caching will not work properly for you. We need some way to omit this headers when calculating
cache name. This option is what you need. Specification hash should contain header name and header value which will be used 
(instead of values in request) while calculating cache name.

For example we already have cache where 'User-Agent' value in the headers was 'Mozilla/5.0', but in the current version of the program 
it will be changed for each request. So we force specified that for cache name calculation 'User-Agent' should be 'Mozilla/5.0'. Cached
request had not 'Accept' header, but in the current version it has. So we force specified do not include this header for cache name
calculation.

    cachename_spec => {
        'User-Agent' => 'Mozilla/5.0',
        'Accept' => undef
    }

Specification hash may contain two special keys: '_body' and '_headers'. With '_body' key you can specify body content in the request
for cache name calculation. For example to not include body content in cache name calculation set '_body' to undef or empty string.
With '_headers' key you can specify which headers should be included in $request for cache name calculation. For example you can say to
include only 'Host' and 'Referer'. '_headers' value should be array reference:

    cachename_spec => {
        _body => undef, # omit body
        _headers => ['Host'], # include only host with value from request
        # It will be smth like:
        # md5_hex("METHOD url\r\nHost: host\r\n\r\n")
        # method and url will be included in any case
    }

Another example. Omit body, include only 'Host' and 'User-Agent' headers, use 'Host' value from request and specified 'User-Agent' value,
in addition include referrer with specified value ('Referer' not specified in '_headers', but values from main specification hash has
higher priority):

    cachename_spec => {
        _body => '',
        _headers => ['Host', 'User-Agent'],
        'User-Agent' => 'Mozilla/5.0',
        'Referer' => 'http://www.com'
    }

One more example. Calculate cache name based only on method and url:

    cachename_spec => {
        _body =>'',
        _headers => []
    }

=head2 last_cached()

Returns list with pathes to files with cache stored by last noncached response. List may contain more than one
element if there was redirect.

=head2 last_used_cache()

Returns list with pathes to files with cache used in last response. This includes files just stored (last_cached)
and files that may be already exists (cached earlier). List may contain more than one element if there was redirect.

=head2 uncache()

Removes last response from the cache. Use case example:

    my $page = $ua->get($url)->decoded_content;
    if ($page =~ /Access for this ip was blocked/) {
        $ua->uncache();
    }

=head1 Proxy and cache name

Here you can see how changing of proxy for useragent will affect cache name

=head2 HTTP proxy

HTTP proxy support works out of the box and causes no problems. Changing of proxy server will not affect cache name

=head2 HTTPS proxy

Proper HTTPS proxy support added in LWP since 6.06 and causes no problems. Changing of proxy server will not affect cache name

=head2 CONNECT proxy

CONNECT proxy support may be added using L<LWP::Protocol::connect|LWP::Protocol::connect>. The problem is that this module uses
LWP's request() for creation of CONNECT tunnel, so this response will be cached. But in fact it shouldn't. To workaround this
you need to install C<nocache_if> hook

    $ua->nocache_if(sub {
        my $resp = shift;
        # do not cache creation of tunnel
        $resp->request->method eq 'CONNECT';
    });

After that it works without problems. Changing of proxy server will not affect cache name

=head2 SOCKS proxy

SOCKS proxy support may be added using L<LWP::Protocol::socks|LWP::Protocol::socks> and causes no problems.
Changing of proxy server will not affect cache name
